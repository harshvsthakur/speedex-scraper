# Speedex Website Scraper

I needed to compare prices of hardware items with prices quoted from local vendors.


This code scrapes the following product information from the Speedex Hardware website

1. SKU
2. Item Description
3. Price


Finally, this information is extracted to an excel sheet using pandas for quick reference. 


The links (urls) are defined by the categories I was interested to get the prices of.

Also defined the number of pages to quickly execute the code. 
This part can be automated to the last page in directory if required.
